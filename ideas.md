- an nn-driven game of life type of thing (about bacteria? about tiny evolving animals?)
- ~~tamagotchi-like game (with a twist???)~~
- quack vs honk.
- ~~fighting/kill-em-all game about keeping yourself alive~~
  - the twist is, the controls are passive
  - neural network? 
    - more like a neural-network inspired map
  - visual manipulation of an ever evolving nn
